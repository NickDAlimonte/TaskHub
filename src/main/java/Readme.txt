This is a very basic CLI project to help me learn some foundational concepts.
As it is, it taught me to map methods to commands I'd parsed into segments from system input.

Just type Add Task (Task Name) to add a new task to the list, and have it displayed in the CLI.

Known issues:
The quit command doesn't work due to incomplete parsing logic with shorter inputs.
I intentionally haven't fixed this, as it's a learning project, not for polishing.
